            <h2>The Privacy Problem with Cloud File Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                Every time you upload a file to a cloud service — whether it's Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer, or
                an email attachment — your data makes a stop on someone else's computer. That "computer" is actually
                a data center operated by a third party, where your file may be stored, indexed, scanned, backed up
                across multiple geographic locations, and retained for periods determined by the provider's policies
                rather than your preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                This isn't necessarily malicious. Cloud providers genuinely need to process and store your data to
                deliver their service. But the implications for privacy are structural:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Third-party access</strong> — the provider can read your files (and some do, for content
                    moderation, malware scanning, or ad targeting)</li>
                <li><strong>Breach exposure</strong> — your files become part of the provider's attack surface. When a
                    cloud service is breached, every user's data is potentially exposed</li>
                <li><strong>Government requests</strong> — providers can be compelled to hand over stored data through
                    legal processes like subpoenas and court orders</li>
                <li><strong>Retention policies</strong> — even after you "delete" a file, copies may persist in backups,
                    logs, and disaster recovery systems for months or years</li>
                <li><strong>Metadata collection</strong> — providers typically log who uploaded what, when, from where,
                    and who downloaded it — building a detailed activity profile</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These aren't hypothetical concerns. Major cloud storage providers have experienced data breaches
                affecting millions of users. Government surveillance programs have been documented to include bulk
                access to cloud provider data. And metadata — even without file contents — can reveal sensitive
                patterns about who you're communicating with and how often.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>How P2P Architecture Solves This</h2>
            <p>
                Peer-to-peer file transfer takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of routing files through a
                central server, P2P creates a direct connection between the sender and recipient. When built on WebRTC
                (as StreamSnatcher is), this connection is encrypted end-to-end using DTLS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The privacy advantages aren't just better policies — they're architectural guarantees:
            </p>

            <h3>No data at rest</h3>
            <p>
                In a P2P transfer, the file travels directly from the sender's browser to the recipient's browser.
                It never "rests" on a server. This is categorically different from a cloud service that stores your
                file (even temporarily) — because data that doesn't exist on a server can't be breached, can't be
                subpoenaed, and can't be retained beyond your control.
            </p>
            <p>
                StreamSnatcher's server component handles only signaling — the exchange of connection metadata that
                allows peers to discover each other. This metadata contains no file names, no file contents, and no
                information about what's being transferred.
            </p>

            <h3>Encryption as a requirement, not a feature</h3>
            <p>
                WebRTC mandates DTLS encryption for all data channels. This isn't a toggle you can forget to enable
                or a premium feature behind a paywall — it's built into the protocol specification. Every byte that
                flows through a WebRTC data channel is encrypted with keys that exist only in the participating
                browsers' memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compare this to cloud services that offer "encryption at rest" — your files are encrypted on their
                servers, but the provider holds the encryption keys. This means they (and anyone who compromises their
                infrastructure) can decrypt your files. True end-to-end encryption, where only the communicating
                parties hold the keys, is the exception in cloud storage — but it's the default in WebRTC.
            </p>

            <h3>Zero-knowledge architecture</h3>
            <p>
                A zero-knowledge architecture means the service provider literally cannot access user data — not
                won't, but can't. In StreamSnatcher's case, file data never passes through the server, so there's
                nothing to access. The encryption keys are negotiated directly between peers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has important legal implications. If StreamSnatcher receives a legal request for user data,
                there is nothing to produce. There are no files, no download logs for file content, and no persistent
                user accounts to identify. The architecture itself is the privacy guarantee — no policy document
                needed.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Why This Matters More in 2026</h2>
            <p>
                Several trends make privacy-first file sharing increasingly important:
            </p>

            <h3>Expanding data protection regulations</h3>
            <p>
                The EU's GDPR, California's CCPA/CPRA, and a growing number of national and state data privacy laws
                impose strict requirements on how personal data is handled. These regulations apply not just to the
                data you collect about users, but to any personal data that passes through your systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                For organizations handling sensitive documents — healthcare providers, legal firms, financial services —
                every file transfer through a cloud service creates regulatory exposure. The provider becomes a data
                processor under GDPR, requiring a data processing agreement, impact assessments, and compliance with
                cross-border transfer restrictions. P2P transfer avoids this entirely: if patient records go directly
                from a doctor's browser to a specialist's browser, no third-party processor is involved.
            </p>

            <h3>Growing breach frequency and impact</h3>
            <p>
                The number and severity of data breaches continue to increase year over year. Cloud storage services
                are high-value targets because they aggregate data from millions of users in centralized infrastructure.
                The more data that's concentrated in one place, the more attractive (and impactful) a breach becomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                P2P file transfer is inherently resistant to this attack pattern. There's no central repository to
                breach. Even if StreamSnatcher's signaling server were compromised, the attacker would gain access
                only to transient connection metadata — no files, no file names, no user accounts.
            </p>

            <h3>AI and automated data analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud providers increasingly use AI to analyze stored data — for content moderation, recommendations,
                training datasets, or advertising. When you upload a file to a cloud service, it may be processed by
                automated systems in ways the privacy policy describes only in broad terms. P2P eliminates this concern
                entirely: if the file never reaches the provider's infrastructure, it can't be analyzed.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Tradeoffs of P2P Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Privacy-first architecture comes with tradeoffs that are important to understand:
            </p>

            <h3>Synchronous presence required</h3>
            <p>
                Both the sender and recipient must be online at the same time. There's no "upload now, download later"
                capability, because there's no server holding the file. For asynchronous sharing scenarios, cloud
                storage remains the practical choice.
            </p>

            <h3>No content moderation</h3>
            <p>
                The same architecture that prevents the provider from reading your files also prevents content
                moderation. StreamSnatcher cannot scan transfers for malware, copyrighted content, or illegal material.
                Users are responsible for verifying the safety and legality of files they receive.
            </p>

            <h3>No recovery from loss</h3>
            <p>
                If a transfer fails or the recipient loses the file, there's no cloud backup to recover from. The
                sender would need to initiate a new transfer. For critical files, consider maintaining your own local
                backups.
            </p>

            <h3>Network-dependent performance</h3>
            <p>
                Transfer speed depends on the network conditions between the two specific peers, not the provider's
                data center bandwidth. On a good connection, P2P can be faster than cloud (one hop instead of two).
                On a poor connection, it can be slower and less reliable.

            <h2>Practical Privacy Tips for File Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                Regardless of which tools you use, these practices improve your file-sharing privacy:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimize cloud exposure</strong> — use P2P for sensitive files that don't need cloud
                    persistence. Reserve cloud storage for files that genuinely need asynchronous access</li>
                <li><strong>Verify recipients</strong> — whether sharing a room code or a cloud link, confirm you're
                    sending to the right person through a separate channel</li>
                <li><strong>Delete after transfer</strong> — if you do use cloud services, delete uploaded files and
                    empty the trash once the recipient confirms receipt</li>
                <li><strong>Use encrypted connections</strong> — ensure both your browser and the recipient's browser
                    are using HTTPS. WebRTC additionally encrypts the data channel with DTLS</li>
                <li><strong>Keep software updated</strong> — browser security patches often address WebRTC
                    vulnerabilities. Always use the latest stable browser version</li>
                <li><strong>Scan received files</strong> — P2P transfers bypass content moderation. Always scan
                    received files with up-to-date antivirus software before opening them</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Privacy in file sharing is not just about having a good privacy policy — it's about architectural
                decisions that determine what data exists, where it lives, and who can access it. Peer-to-peer
                architecture, built on WebRTC's mandatory encryption, provides structural privacy guarantees that
                cloud services cannot match: no server-side data storage, no provider access to file contents, and
                no persistent records of transfer activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This doesn't make cloud storage obsolete — it remains the right tool for asynchronous sharing,
                long-term storage, and collaborative editing. But for transfers where privacy matters, where files
                are sensitive, or where you simply don't want your data sitting on someone else's server, P2P is
                the architecturally sound choice.
