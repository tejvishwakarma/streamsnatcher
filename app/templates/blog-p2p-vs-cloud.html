            <h2>Two Fundamentally Different Architectures</h2>
            <p>
                At their core, P2P and cloud file transfer use completely different architectures to move data from
                point A to point B. Understanding this difference is key to choosing the right tool:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cloud transfer (store-and-forward):</strong> The sender uploads the file to a central server.
                The
                server stores it. The recipient downloads it from that server. The file makes two trips — once up, once
                down — through the provider's infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>P2P transfer (direct):</strong> A direct, encrypted connection is established between the
                sender's
                and recipient's browsers. The file travels directly from one to the other. No central server touches
                the file data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neither architecture is universally "better." Each excels in different scenarios. This article provides
                an honest comparison across the dimensions that matter most.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Speed Comparison</h2>

            <h3>P2P advantage: One hop instead of two</h3>
            <p>
                In a cloud transfer, your file makes two trips: sender → server, then server → recipient. Each trip is
                limited by the slower of the endpoint's bandwidth and the server's capacity. If you're uploading a 5 GB
                file over a 50 Mbps upload connection, that's approximately 13 minutes of upload — before the recipient
                even starts downloading.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a P2P transfer, the file makes one trip: sender → recipient. The effective speed is limited by the
                sender's upload bandwidth and the recipient's download bandwidth, whichever is slower. There's no
                intermediate upload/download cycle.
            </p>

            <h3>P2P advantage: Local network transfers</h3>
            <p>
                When both devices are on the same local network (same Wi-Fi, same office), P2P transfers can be
                dramatically faster because data never leaves the local network. WebRTC's ICE process discovers the
                local network path and uses it directly. A file that would take 10 minutes through a cloud service
                (upload over the internet, download back over the internet) might transfer in under a minute over
                the LAN.
            </p>

            <h3>Cloud advantage: Server-side CDN acceleration</h3>
            <p>
                Large cloud providers operate content delivery networks (CDNs) with edge servers worldwide. When
                downloading a file, the recipient may connect to a nearby edge server, reducing latency. This can
                make downloads faster than connecting directly to the sender, especially when the sender has a
                slow or distant connection.
            </p>

            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                P2P is faster for real-time, synchronous transfers — especially on local networks. Cloud services can
                be faster for cross-continent transfers where CDN acceleration outperforms a direct connection between
                two endpoints with high latency.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Privacy Comparison</h2>

            <h3>P2P advantage: No server-side data</h3>
            <p>
                In a P2P transfer via WebRTC, the file never exists on any server. The signaling server (which
                facilitates the connection handshake) sees only session metadata — no file names, no file contents,
                no download history. Encryption keys are negotiated between the two peers, so not even the signaling
                server can decrypt the data.
            </p>

            <h3>Cloud reality: Provider access to your data</h3>
            <p>
                Most cloud storage providers encrypt data "at rest" on their servers, but they hold the encryption
                keys. This means they can (and sometimes must) access your data for content moderation, legal
                compliance, malware scanning, or service improvements. Your files exist on their infrastructure,
                subject to their retention policies, their security practices, and their jurisdiction's legal
                framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some providers offer true end-to-end encryption (where only the user holds the keys), but this is
                typically a premium feature, not the default, and it often comes with limitations on search,
                preview, and collaboration features.
            </p>

            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                P2P provides structural privacy guarantees that cloud services cannot match. If privacy is a primary
                concern — for sensitive documents, regulated data, or personal preference — P2P is the stronger choice.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>

            <h3>P2P: Free at the protocol level</h3>
            <p>
                WebRTC is an open standard built into every major browser. There are no licensing fees, no per-GB
                transfer charges, and no premium tiers needed for basic file transfer. Tools like StreamSnatcher
                provide the full P2P file transfer experience at zero cost with no usage limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The infrastructure costs for running a P2P file transfer service are minimal compared to cloud storage.
                The server only handles signaling (lightweight WebSocket messages), not the actual file data. This is
                why P2P services can sustainably offer free unlimited transfers.
            </p>

            <h3>Cloud: Free tiers with strict limits</h3>
            <p>
                Most cloud storage services offer free tiers — typically 2 GB to 15 GB of storage — with per-file
                or total storage limits. Exceeding these requires paid subscriptions, often ranging from $2 to $10
                per month for 100 GB to 2 TB of storage. File-sending services like WeTransfer limit free transfers
                to 2 GB per send.
            </p>
            <p>
                For occasional file sharing, free tiers may be sufficient. For regular large-file transfers (video
                production, software development, photography), costs can accumulate.
            </p>

            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                P2P is genuinely free with no limits. Cloud services are free for small, infrequent use but become
                paid services for larger or more frequent needs.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>File Size Limits</h2>

            <h3>P2P: No artificial limits</h3>
            <p>
                WebRTC data channels have no file size limit in the protocol specification. The practical ceiling is
                determined by the sending device's ability to read the file and the receiving device's available memory
                and storage. Files of 10 GB, 50 GB, or larger can be transferred, limited only by hardware and network
                stability.
            </p>

            <h3>Cloud: Service-imposed caps</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud services impose file size limits based on their business model and infrastructure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email attachments</strong> — 25 MB (Gmail), 20 MB (Outlook)</li>
                <li><strong>WeTransfer free</strong> — 2 GB per transfer</li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive</strong> — 5 TB individual file limit (15 GB free storage total)</li>
                <li><strong>Dropbox free</strong> — 2 GB total storage</li>
                <li><strong>OneDrive free</strong> — 5 GB total storage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                P2P has no artificial limits — you can transfer a 100 GB file if your device and network support it.
                Cloud services work for smaller files but require paid plans for regular large-file transfers.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Availability and Persistence</h2>

            <h3>Cloud advantage: Asynchronous access</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest practical advantage of cloud storage is asynchronous access. Upload a file, send a link,
                and the recipient can download it hours, days, or weeks later. The file persists on the server
                regardless of whether the sender is online. This is essential for scenarios where sender and recipient
                are in different time zones or can't coordinate schedules.
            </p>

            <h3>P2P limitation: Both peers must be online</h3>
            <p>
                P2P requires both the sender and recipient to have their browsers open simultaneously. There is no
                server holding the file for later retrieval. If the sender closes their tab, the file is gone — it
                was never stored anywhere except on the sender's device.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a fundamental property of the architecture, not a missing feature. It's the direct consequence
                of the privacy benefit: if files aren't stored on servers, they can't be accessed later from servers.
            </p>

            <h3>Verdict</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud services are clearly better for asynchronous sharing. P2P is designed for real-time, synchronous
                transfers where both parties are available.

            <p>
                Peer-to-peer transfer is the better choice when:

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Privacy is important</strong> — sensitive documents, personal files, regulated data

                    exports that exceed cloud free tier limits</li>
                <li><strong>Both parties are available now</strong> — real-time handoffs during calls, meetings,
                    in-person exchanges</li>
                <li><strong>Speed matters</strong> — especially on local networks where P2P eliminates the cloud

            <h2>Conclusion: Different Tools for Different Jobs</h2>
            <p>
                P2P and cloud storage aren't competitors — they're complementary tools designed for different scenarios.
                Cloud storage excels at persistence, collaboration, and asynchronous access. P2P excels at speed,
                privacy, and simplicity for real-time transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The practical approach is to use both: cloud storage for files that need to persist and be accessed
                by multiple people over time, and P2P for files that need to get from point A to point B right now,
                securely, without leaving traces on third-party servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                StreamSnatcher makes the P2P side of this equation accessible to everyone at zero cost.
