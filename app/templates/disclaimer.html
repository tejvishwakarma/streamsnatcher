      StreamSnatcher facilitates direct, encrypted, browser‑to‑browser file transfers using WebRTC; transfer outcomes can vary due to factors outside the platform’s control, and files are not stored on servers.
    </p>

    <!-- Purpose of the service -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Purpose of the service</h2>
      <p>
        StreamSnatcher provides a peer‑to‑peer file transfer interface designed for convenience and privacy, enabling users to send files directly between devices without uploading content to servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform does not provide cloud storage, backup, or content hosting, and sessions are intended for real‑time transfers only.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- No file storage or access -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>No file storage or access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Files are not uploaded to or stored on servers during transfers.</li>
        <li>Contents of files are not inspected, moderated, or indexed by the platform.</li>
        <li>Transfers occur over encrypted channels between participating devices only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because files never reside on servers, the platform cannot retrieve, restore, or provide copies of transferred content.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- User responsibilities -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>User responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that any content shared complies with applicable laws and that you have the right to transmit it.</li>
        <li>Verify recipients and share session codes or QR codes only with trusted parties.</li>
        <li>Use reputable antivirus tools and scan files before and after transfer to reduce risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for the content you send or receive and for any consequences arising from its use.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- No warranties -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>No warranties</h2>
      <p>
        The service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non‑infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transfer speed, reliability, and compatibility depend on network conditions, device capabilities, browser behavior, and peer availability, and cannot be guaranteed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Limits and risks -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Limits and risks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Highly restrictive networks and firewalls may require relay paths that can impact peak speeds.</li>
        <li>Background browser policies, device sleep, or tab throttling can slow or pause large transfers.</li>
        <li>Interruptions or disconnections may require peers to rejoin the session and restart the transfer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where relay is required by network conditions, encryption remains in place while throughput may vary.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Third‑party services -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
      <p>
        The platform may rely on standard WebRTC signaling and connectivity services (such as STUN/TURN) to establish sessions, which process limited technical metadata necessary for peer discovery and connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where analytics or advertising are integrated, participating vendors may process limited identifiers and events consistent with consent controls and applicable policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third‑party services operate under their own terms and policies, and the platform is not responsible for those providers.
