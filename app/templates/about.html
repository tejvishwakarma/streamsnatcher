    <!-- Mission -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        StreamSnatcher exists because sharing a file should be as simple as handing someone a flash drive — except
        without the flash drive. Traditional file sharing forces you through a roundabout journey: upload your file
        to a cloud server, wait for it to finish, copy a link, send it to your recipient, then wait again while
        they download from that same server. Along the way, your data sits on someone else's computer,
        accessible to the service provider, potentially exposed to breaches, and subject to storage quotas.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built StreamSnatcher to eliminate that entire middle step. By leveraging WebRTC — the same technology
        that makes browser-based video calls possible — files travel directly from your browser to the
        recipient's browser. There is no upload, no cloud storage, and no download link. The transfer is
        immediate, the architecture is private by default, and the service is free to use without registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make peer-to-peer file transfer accessible to everyone: individuals sharing family
        photos, teams exchanging design assets, professionals transferring sensitive documents, and anyone who
        values speed and privacy over the convenience theater of cloud-first workflows.

    <!-- Why StreamSnatcher -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Why StreamSnatcher?</h2>
      <p>
        Most file-sharing tools are built around a server-centric model: your file goes up to the cloud, then
        back down to the recipient. This works, but it introduces latency (you wait for two transfers instead
        of one), privacy concerns (a third party stores your data), and artificial limits (free tiers cap file
        sizes at 2 GB, 5 GB, or 25 MB for email attachments).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct peer‑to‑peer transfers</strong> — files flow between browsers with no server storage, ever.
          Your data never sits on someone else's infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Real‑time speed</strong> — on a local network, transfers can saturate your connection because
          there's no cloud middleman adding latency.</li>
        <li><strong>No sign‑in required</strong> — create a session and start transferring in under ten seconds. No
          email verification, no password, no profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Works across modern browsers</strong> — Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, and Brave all support
          the WebRTC standard that StreamSnatcher is built on.</li>
        <li><strong>No file size limits</strong> — send a 50 KB text file or a 50 GB video project. The practical
          ceiling is your device's memory and storage, not an artificial quota.</li>
        <li><strong>Built‑in encryption</strong> — WebRTC data channels use DTLS encryption by default. Your files are
          protected in transit without any extra configuration.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- The Technology -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>The Technology Behind StreamSnatcher</h2>
      <p>
        StreamSnatcher is built on <strong>WebRTC</strong> (Web Real-Time Communication), an open-source framework
        originally developed by Google and now standardized by the W3C and IETF. WebRTC was designed to enable
        real-time audio and video communication directly between browsers, but its <strong>data channel</strong>
        capability is equally powerful for transferring arbitrary binary data — including files of any type and size.
      </p>

      <h3>How WebRTC data channels work</h3>
      <p>
        When two peers want to exchange files, their browsers perform a handshake process called
        <strong>signaling</strong>. During signaling, each browser generates an SDP (Session Description Protocol)
        offer describing its capabilities, and they exchange ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) candidates
        — essentially, lists of network addresses the browsers can use to reach each other. StreamSnatcher's
        server facilitates this signaling exchange, but once the connection is established, the server is no longer
        involved in the data flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting peer connection uses <strong>SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)</strong> over
        <strong>DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)</strong>, which provides both encryption and reliable,
        ordered delivery of data. Files are split into chunks, sent through this encrypted channel, and reassembled
        on the receiving end — all within the browser, with no plugins or extensions required.
      </p>

      <h3>NAT traversal: STUN and TURN</h3>
      <p>
        Most devices sit behind NAT (Network Address Translation) routers, which means they don't have direct
        public IP addresses. WebRTC uses <strong>STUN</strong> (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) servers to
        help each peer discover its public-facing IP address and port. In most cases, this is sufficient to
        establish a direct connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        When both peers are behind symmetric NATs or restrictive firewalls that prevent direct connections,
        WebRTC falls back to a <strong>TURN</strong> (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) server, which relays
        data between peers. While this adds latency, the data remains encrypted end-to-end. StreamSnatcher
        configures both STUN and TURN servers to maximize connectivity across different network environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Open standards, no vendor lock-in</h3>
      <p>
        Because WebRTC is an open W3C standard implemented natively in every major browser engine (Blink, Gecko,
        and WebKit), StreamSnatcher doesn't depend on proprietary plugins, third-party SDKs, or platform-specific
        runtimes. This means the service works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android — any device with
        a modern browser can participate in file transfers without installing anything.

    <!-- Privacy by design -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Privacy by Design</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy isn't a feature we added on top of an existing architecture — it's a consequence of the
        architecture itself. When files never pass through a centralized server, there's nothing to log,
        nothing to scan, and nothing to subpoena. Here's how this works in practice:
      </p>
      <div class="security-points">
        <div class="security-point">
          <div class="security-icon">🔒</div>
          <h4>End‑to‑end encrypted</h4>
          <p>All transfers use DTLS-encrypted WebRTC data channels. Encryption keys are negotiated directly between
            peers, so StreamSnatcher — and your ISP — never see the plaintext content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="security-point">
          <div class="security-icon">🗂️</div>
          <h4>No server file storage</h4>
          <p>Files never touch our servers. We don't have the infrastructure to store, inspect, or index your data. The
            server only facilitates the initial connection handshake.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="security-point">
          <div class="security-icon">🧭</div>
          <h4>Minimal technical metadata</h4>
          <p>We process only the minimum metadata needed for connection establishment: session IDs, ICE candidates, and
            short-lived diagnostic logs that are discarded after the session ends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="security-point">
          <div class="security-icon">⚙️</div>
          <h4>User control</h4>
          <p>Sessions are entirely ephemeral. Close the browser tab, and the session — along with all associated
            connection data — ceases to exist. There are no persistent user accounts or activity histories.</p>
