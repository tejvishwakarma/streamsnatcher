        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How do I start a file transfer?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Create a session on the homepage by clicking the "Start Transfer" button. This generates a unique room
              code and a scannable QR code. Share either one with the person you want to exchange files with —
              they can join by scanning the QR code or opening the link in their browser.</p>
            <p>Once a peer connects, simply drag and drop files into the upload zone. The transfer begins
              immediately and progress is shown in real time. Keep the browser tab open and active until all
              transfers are complete, as closing the tab ends the session.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Do I need an account?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No — StreamSnatcher is designed for instant, frictionless use. There are no sign‑up forms, email
              verifications, or user profiles. Sessions are completely ephemeral: they exist only while the page is
              open and peers are connected, leaving no persistent traces on our end.</p>
            <p>This design choice is intentional. By removing accounts, we eliminate a common attack surface for
              data breaches and ensure your file-sharing activity is never tied to a persistent identity.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is there a file size limit?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>StreamSnatcher does not impose any artificial file size limit. You can transfer files ranging from
              small text documents to multi‑gigabyte video files or project archives. The practical ceiling is
              determined by your browser's available memory, your device's storage capacity, and the stability of
              your network connection.</p>
            <p>For very large files (10 GB+), we recommend using a wired Ethernet connection and keeping the
              browser tab in the foreground to avoid throttling by the operating system.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I send multiple files at once?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. You can select multiple files or drag and drop an entire batch into the upload zone. Each file
              is queued and transferred sequentially, with individual progress bars showing the status of each file
              in the queue. You can continue adding more files while transfers are in progress.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Are files uploaded to servers?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. Files are never uploaded to StreamSnatcher's servers. All transfers happen directly between
              your browser and the recipient's browser over encrypted WebRTC data channels. Our server's only role
              is to facilitate the initial connection handshake (called "signaling") — once peers discover each
              other, all file data flows directly between devices.</p>
            <p>This means we physically cannot access, read, or store your files. Even if subpoenaed, there is
              nothing to produce because the data never exists on our infrastructure.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is the transfer encrypted?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. WebRTC mandates DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) encryption for all data channels.
              This is the same encryption standard used by major video conferencing platforms like Google Meet and
              Microsoft Teams. The encryption keys are negotiated directly between peers during the connection
              setup, so contents are not visible to StreamSnatcher, your ISP, or any intermediary.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that this is transport-layer encryption. While your data is protected in
              transit, you should still only share files with people you trust, as the recipient has full access
              to the decrypted file once received.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What data does StreamSnatcher collect?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We collect the minimum technical metadata needed to establish connections: session identifiers,
              ICE candidates (network routing information), and short‑lived diagnostic data for stability
              improvements. We do not collect file names, file contents, or any data about what you transfer.</p>
            <p>Session data is discarded when the session ends. For full details, review our

          <summary class="faq-question">Can I use StreamSnatcher with a VPN?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, StreamSnatcher generally works with VPNs. However, some VPN configurations may affect WebRTC
              connectivity or reduce transfer speeds because your traffic is routed through an additional server.
              If you experience connection issues while using a VPN, try temporarily disabling it or switching to
              a different VPN server location closer to your peer.</p>
            <p>Note that some privacy-focused browser extensions may block WebRTC to prevent IP leakage. If you
              use such extensions, you may need to whitelist streamsnatcher.com for transfers to work.</p>

      <h2>Performance &amp; Reliability</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How fast are transfers?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Transfer speed is determined by the slower of the sender's upload bandwidth and the receiver's
              download bandwidth. On a typical broadband connection, expect speeds between 5–50 Mbps for direct
              peer‑to‑peer connections. On local networks (e.g., same Wi‑Fi), speeds can be significantly
              higher since data doesn't traverse the public internet.</p>
            <p>If both devices are behind restrictive NATs or firewalls, the connection may route through a
              TURN relay server, which can reduce speeds. For best results, use wired connections and avoid
              congested networks.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Why did my transfer pause or slow down?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Several factors can cause transfers to pause or slow down. Modern browsers actively throttle
              background tabs to conserve resources — keep the StreamSnatcher tab in the foreground during large
              transfers. Mobile devices may enter sleep mode, cutting the network connection. Shared networks
              (offices, cafes, dorms) may have bandwidth caps or high contention.</p>
            <p>Try these troubleshooting steps: keep the tab visible and active, disable sleep/screen-off on your
              device during transfers, close bandwidth-heavy apps (streaming video, large downloads), and switch
              to a more stable connection if available.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What if peers can't connect?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Connection failures are usually caused by restrictive networks. Common solutions include:
              refreshing both browser tabs and verifying the room code matches exactly, disabling aggressive
              ad-blockers or tracker-blocking extensions that may interfere with WebRTC signaling, and trying
              a different network (a mobile hotspot can quickly confirm whether the ISP is the issue).</p>
            <p>Corporate firewalls, university networks, and some public Wi‑Fi hotspots are known to block WebRTC
              traffic. If you consistently can't connect from a particular network, it's likely a firewall
              restriction. Using a VPN or switching to mobile data usually resolves this.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">What should I do if my transfer is slow?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Slow transfers are typically caused by network conditions rather than StreamSnatcher itself. Start
              by switching from Wi‑Fi to a wired Ethernet connection if possible, as wired connections offer
              more stable and consistent bandwidth. Close other applications that consume bandwidth, such as
              video streaming or cloud sync services.</p>
            <p>If speeds remain low after optimizing your connection, the transfer may be routing through a TURN
              relay due to firewall restrictions on one or both sides. Try connecting both devices to less
              restrictive networks. For very large files, consider transferring during off‑peak hours when
              network congestion is lower.</p>

      <h2>Browser &amp; Device Compatibility</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Which browsers are supported?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>StreamSnatcher works on all modern browsers that support WebRTC data channels. This includes
              Google Chrome (version 56+), Mozilla Firefox (version 52+), Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based),
              Safari (version 11+), Opera, and Brave. For the best experience, always keep your browser
              updated to the latest stable version.</p>
            <p>Internet Explorer is not supported, and some niche or heavily customized browsers may lack full
              WebRTC data channel support. If you encounter issues, try switching to Chrome or Firefox as a
              baseline test.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Does it work on mobile?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. StreamSnatcher works on mobile browsers with WebRTC support, including Chrome and Safari on
              iOS, and Chrome and Firefox on Android. The interface is fully responsive and optimized for
              touchscreens, making it easy to upload files and manage transfers on smaller screens.</p>
            <p>For long transfers on mobile, keep the screen on and the browser app in the foreground. iOS and
              Android aggressively suspend background processes to save battery, which can interrupt active
              WebRTC connections. On Android, you can enable "Keep screen on while charging" in developer
              settings for extended transfers.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How many peers can join a session?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Each session supports up to 2 peers for optimal performance and reliability. This direct
              one‑to‑one architecture ensures the fastest possible transfer speeds without the overhead of
              managing multiple simultaneous connections, which can significantly reduce per‑peer throughput.</p>
            <p>If you need to share with multiple people, you can create separate sessions for each recipient
              or share files one pair at a time within the same session.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I bookmark or save a session for later?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Sessions are designed to be ephemeral and cannot be bookmarked for later use. Each session exists
              only while at least one peer has the page open. When all participants close the tab, the session
              is permanently ended and the room code becomes invalid.</p>
            <p>This is a deliberate privacy feature — by ensuring sessions have no persistence, we eliminate
              the risk of unauthorized access to stale session links.</p>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Which file types are supported?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Any file type can be transferred through StreamSnatcher — documents (PDF, DOCX, XLSX), images
              (JPEG, PNG, RAW), videos (MP4, MOV, AVI), audio (MP3, WAV, FLAC), archives (ZIP, RAR, TAR),
              application binaries (EXE, DMG, APK), and more. StreamSnatcher treats all files as binary data
              streams, so there are no format restrictions.</p>
            <p>If a particular file fails to transfer, it's typically due to browser memory limitations for
              extremely large files or network interruptions, not a file type restriction.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Are files compressed during transfer?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. Files are transferred bit‑for‑bit without any compression, transcoding, or modification.
              What the sender uploads is exactly what the receiver downloads. This is particularly important
              for media professionals who need lossless quality — your RAW photos, uncompressed video, and
              master audio files arrive exactly as they were sent.</p>
            <p>If you want to reduce transfer time for large batches, consider compressing files into a ZIP
              archive before sending. This is especially effective for text‑heavy files and documents.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Can I resume a failed transfer?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Currently, StreamSnatcher does not support resumable transfers. If a transfer is interrupted due
              to a disconnection or browser crash, you'll need to rejoin the session (if it's still active) and
              resend the file from the beginning. For very large files on unstable connections, we recommend
              splitting files into smaller chunks before transferring.</p>
            <p>Resumable transfer support is on our development roadmap, and we plan to implement it in a
              future update to improve the experience for large file transfers over unreliable connections.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How do I verify file integrity after transfer?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>WebRTC data channels use SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), which provides built‑in
              reliability guarantees including ordered delivery and retransmission of lost packets. This means
              files arrive intact under normal conditions. However, for critical transfers, you can independently

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No. Because files flow directly between peers and never pass through or get stored on
              StreamSnatcher's servers, content moderation is not technically feasible. We are unable to see,
              access, or scan the contents of any transfer.</p>
            <p>Users are solely responsible for ensuring they only share content they have the legal right to
              distribute. Always scan received files with up-to-date antivirus software before opening them,
              especially when receiving from unfamiliar sources.</p>

          <summary class="faq-question">Is StreamSnatcher free?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. The core file transfer service is completely free to use with no hidden fees, premium tiers,
              or usage caps. We believe that basic file sharing should be accessible to everyone, regardless of
              budget. There are no "free trial" limits — you get the full product at no cost.</p>
            <p>To sustain the service, non-intrusive advertising may be displayed on content pages. Ads are
              placed away from the transfer interface and never interrupt active file transfers.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">How does StreamSnatcher sustain itself?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>StreamSnatcher is sustained through non‑intrusive display advertising on content pages. Because
              file transfers are peer‑to‑peer (data flows directly between users), our server costs are
              minimal compared to traditional cloud storage services. This lean architecture allows us to
              offer the full service for free while remaining financially sustainable through modest ad
              revenue.</p>
            <p>Ad placement is carefully considered to avoid disrupting transfers or degrading the user
              experience. We follow all applicable consent and privacy regulations.</p>
