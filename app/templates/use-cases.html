        <!-- Overview -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                StreamSnatcher is built for scenarios where <strong>speed, privacy, and simplicity</strong> matter more
                than long-term cloud storage. Instead of uploading files to a server, waiting, then having recipients
                download from that server, StreamSnatcher creates a direct encrypted connection between two browsers.
                Files transfer at the maximum speed your network allows, never touch a third-party server, and leave
                no trace once the session ends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are detailed scenarios organized by user type. Each includes practical examples and specific
                advantages of using peer-to-peer transfer over traditional cloud services.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Personal Sharing -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Personal Sharing</h2>

            <h3>Photos and Videos</h3>
            <p>
                Modern smartphone cameras capture photos at 48–200 megapixels and record video in 4K or higher. A single
                vacation album can easily exceed 5 GB — beyond the attachment limits of email (25 MB for Gmail) and
                challenging even for cloud drive free tiers. StreamSnatcher handles these transfers with no size limit
                and zero compression, so your recipients get the exact full-resolution originals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> After a family reunion, you want to share 150 RAW photos (2 GB total) with a
                relative. Instead of uploading to Google Drive and waiting 20 minutes, create a StreamSnatcher session,
                have them scan the QR code, and start the direct transfer immediately. The files arrive at full quality
                with no cloud copy left behind.
            </p>

            <h3>Documents and Records</h3>
            <p>
                Tax returns, medical records, legal contracts, and personal financial statements contain sensitive
                information that you may not want sitting on a cloud server — even temporarily. StreamSnatcher ensures
                these files travel encrypted directly between devices, with no intermediary storage, no download links
                that could be intercepted, and no retention period to worry about.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> You need to send your accountant a complete set of tax documents. Instead of
                emailing PDFs (unencrypted in transit between mail servers), create a session and transfer the files
                during your phone call. They arrive instantly, encrypted in transit, and leave no cloud footprint.
            </p>

            <h3>Device-to-Device File Migration</h3>
            <p>
                Setting up a new laptop, switching phones, or moving files between your desktop and tablet shouldn't
                require a cloud service or a USB cable. StreamSnatcher turns any two devices with a browser into a
                direct
                file transfer pipeline — no apps to install, no accounts to create.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> You just got a new laptop and want to copy over your Documents folder (8 GB)
                from the old one. Both machines are on the same Wi-Fi. Create a session on one, scan the QR on the
                other,
                and transfer directly at LAN speed — no internet upload/download required, since the data stays on your
                local network.
            </p>

        <!-- Team and Work -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>👨‍💼 Professional &amp; Team Workflows</h2>

            <h3>Design and Media Production</h3>
            <p>
                Design teams regularly exchange large assets: Photoshop files (500 MB+), Figma exports, video drafts
                (5–50 GB),
                3D renders, and font packages. Cloud services impose file size limits on free tiers and throttle upload
                speeds. StreamSnatcher transfers these assets directly between team members' machines at full network
                speed with no size restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A video editor needs to send a 12 GB ProRes file to the colorist sitting
                across
                the office. Both are on the same gigabit network. StreamSnatcher transfers the file in minutes over the
                LAN,
                compared to the 30+ minute upload-then-download cycle through the company's cloud drive.
            </p>

            <h3>Software Development</h3>
            <p>
                Build artifacts, Docker images, database dumps, and compiled binaries can be large and cumbersome to
                share.
                When they contain proprietary code, uploading to external cloud services may violate company policy or
                client
                agreements. StreamSnatcher keeps these files strictly between the participating devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> During a code review, a developer needs to share a 3 GB debug build with a QA
                engineer for immediate testing. Instead of pushing to an artifact server and waiting for the download,
                they share a room code and transfer the build directly.
            </p>

            <h3>Client Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
                Agencies, freelancers, and consultants regularly deliver work products — final reports, presentation
                decks,
                creative assets — to clients. StreamSnatcher enables instant delivery during review calls, eliminating
                the
                "I'll send you a link after the meeting" delay and ensuring deliverables arrive without going through
                a third-party server.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Education -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>🎓 Education</h2>

            <h3>Classroom File Exchange</h3>
            <p>
                In physical classrooms, students and instructors often need to share files quickly — project
                submissions,
                lecture slides, code samples, lab data. Institutional email may have strict attachment limits, and
                students may not all have access to the same cloud platform. StreamSnatcher works in any browser without
                accounts, making it accessible to everyone in the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A computer science professor wants to distribute a 200 MB starter code package
                to 30 students at the beginning of a lab. They project the QR code on screen. Students scan it on their
                phones or laptops and receive the files instantly, without needing to log into any service.
            </p>

            <h3>Research Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                Research teams at different institutions may need to share datasets, simulation results, or draft papers
                that contain unpublished findings or sensitive data. StreamSnatcher provides a quick, private channel
                for these exchanges without the compliance concerns of uploading to consumer cloud services.
            </p>

            <h3>Workshop and Training Sessions</h3>
            <p>
                Conference workshops, hackathons, and training sessions often involve distributing starter kits, sample
                datasets, or configuration files. Participants come from different organizations with different (and
                potentially blocked) cloud platforms. StreamSnatcher works over any network that allows WebRTC,
                bypassing
                platform fragmentation entirely.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Events and Creators -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>🎨 Events &amp; Content Creators</h2>

            <h3>On-Site Media Handoff</h3>
            <p>
                Event photographers and videographers generate gigabytes of footage on-site and need to hand it off to
                editors quickly — sometimes before the event is even over. Cloud uploads from venue Wi-Fi are often
                painfully slow or unreliable. StreamSnatcher creates a direct connection between the camera laptop and
                the editor's workstation, transferring footage at LAN speed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A wedding photographer finishes the ceremony shoot with 40 GB of RAW photos.
                While the reception is underway, they create a StreamSnatcher session and transfer the photos directly
                to the second photographer's editing laptop via a portable hotspot. The editor can start culling and
                retouching before the event ends.
            </p>

            <h3>Content Creator Collaborations</h3>
            <p>
                YouTubers, podcasters, and streamers frequently collaborate by sharing B-roll, audio tracks, graphics,
                and project files. These are often large (10+ GB) and contain unreleased content that shouldn't sit on
                public cloud storage. StreamSnatcher's encrypted, ephemeral transfers are ideal for these exchanges.
            </p>

            <h3>Rapid Review Cycles</h3>
            <p>
                During editing sessions, creators and their clients go through multiple review rounds. Each revision may
                involve sending a 2–5 GB video render for feedback. StreamSnatcher lets you send the latest cut
                immediately
                during a video call, get feedback in real time, and send the next revision — all without the
                upload-wait-download
                cycle of cloud services.

        <!-- Healthcare & Legal -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>🏥 Healthcare &amp; Legal</h2>

            <h3>Medical Records Exchange</h3>
            <p>
                Healthcare providers and patients sometimes need to exchange medical records, imaging files (DICOM), or
                lab results outside of formal EHR portals. These files are protected under regulations like HIPAA and
                GDPR. StreamSnatcher's architecture — where files never touch a third-party server — provides a
                privacy-first channel for these sensitive transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> While StreamSnatcher provides encrypted, server-free transfer, organizations
                should evaluate whether its privacy model meets their specific regulatory requirements before using it
                for governed data.
            </p>

            <h3>Legal Document Exchange</h3>
            <p>
                Attorneys, paralegals, and clients regularly exchange confidential documents — contracts, discovery
                materials, deposition transcripts — that should not be stored on general-purpose cloud services.
                StreamSnatcher provides a direct, encrypted transfer without creating copies on third-party
                infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h3>Financial Services</h3>
            <p>
                Financial advisors, accountants, and their clients handle tax returns, investment statements, and
                banking documents. These contain personally identifiable information that requires careful handling.
                StreamSnatcher's peer-to-peer model ensures these documents go directly from one person to another
                without intermediary storage.
            </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>💻 Device-to-Device Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                StreamSnatcher doubles as a universal device transfer tool. Any two devices with a modern browser can
                exchange files directly — no cables, no apps, no same-ecosystem requirement.
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Cross-platform</strong> — transfer between Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android using
                    only a browser</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-ecosystem</strong> — share between Apple and Android devices, or between a phone and a
                    Linux workstation</li>
                <li><strong>Local network speed</strong> — when both devices are on the same Wi-Fi, data stays on the
                    LAN for maximum throughput</li>
                <li><strong>No installation</strong> — works in the browser; no app downloads, no drivers, no
                    configuration</li>
                <li><strong>One-time transfers</strong> — perfect for quick file moves where a permanent cloud copy
                    isn't needed</li>

            <h2>🛠️ Remote Technical Support</h2>
            <p>
                IT support teams and developers often need to exchange diagnostic files, configuration patches,
                screenshots, and log files with end users during troubleshooting sessions. StreamSnatcher makes this
                fast and private:
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Diagnostic exchange</strong> — receive crash logs, screenshots, and system configuration
                    exports directly from the user's device</li>
                <li><strong>Patch delivery</strong> — send configuration files, scripts, or hotfix builds to the user
                    without setting up a file-sharing service</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy-safe support</strong> — sensitive diagnostics (memory dumps, network traces) stay
                    between the support agent and the user</li>
                <li><strong>No shared drives needed</strong> — works without granting access to corporate cloud storage
                    or setting up temporary permissions</li>

        <!-- Best Practices -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>
                Regardless of your use case, follow these guidelines for the best experience:
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Use a stable connection</strong> — prefer Wi-Fi or Ethernet over cellular data, and avoid
                    networks with captive portals (hotel, café Wi-Fi) that may block WebRTC</li>
                <li><strong>Keep the tab active</strong> — browsers throttle background tabs; keep StreamSnatcher in the
                    foreground during transfers</li>
                <li><strong>Share room codes securely</strong> — treat the room code like a password; share it only with
                    trusted participants</li>
                <li><strong>Scan received files</strong> — always verify file integrity and scan with antivirus software
                    before opening files from unfamiliar senders</li>
                <li><strong>Try a different network on failure</strong> — if peers can't connect, the network may be
                    blocking WebRTC; try a mobile hotspot to confirm</li>
            </ul>
